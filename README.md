# Law_Master_BOT

The Law_Master Bot created under 10 minutes to honour our Lord & Saviour, The Godfather of the children of Israel Law_Master.
Created with Nodejs - Version 0.0.1

(This bot is a joke or is it?)

**How do I host this?**

Download it and extract the ZIP File.
Once extracted, open the folder and follow the folder path below:
.> BotData > Settings > Settings.json

Create a discord bot via Discord Developer (https://discord.com/developers/applications)
Copy the Token and paste it in Settings.json (Search for the `TOKEN-HERE` statement)

Your bot is ready to be hosted, choose a hosting of your choosing and enjoy this joke of a project :)
